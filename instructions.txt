Accurate Instruction

-Parsing the puzzle:

	The puzzle input is a string, so first we’ll convert it into a 2D array for easier manipulation.
	Identify the positions where the words should go based on the numbers in the puzzle string.
	
-Fitting words:

	We need to try to fit each word into the positions defined by the numbers in the puzzle.
	Words must be placed in both horizontal and vertical directions, while ensuring no overlap conflicts.

-Backtracking:

	If a word doesn’t fit in a particular position, backtrack and try the next word in the list.

-Error Handling:

	If more than one solution is possible, or the puzzle and words don’t guarantee a unique solution, output Error.
